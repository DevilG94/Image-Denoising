Image Denoising is a computer vision task that involves removing noise from an image. Noise can be introduced into an image during acquisition or processing, and can reduce image quality and make it difficult to interpret. 
Image denoising techniques aim to restore an image to its original quality by reducing or removing the noise, 
while preserving the important features of the image.
